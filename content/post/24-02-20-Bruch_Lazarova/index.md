We encourage you to take a look at our most recent work entitled "Mod5 mediates a molecular trade-off between optimal gene expression and antifungal resistance." The preprint is available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.19.578369v1). 

We are always excited to share more RNA regulation in fungal pathogens!
