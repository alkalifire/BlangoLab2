__Tell me more__

Pamela discovered her passion for microbiology during her studies at the [Friedrich Schiller University](https://www.uni-jena.de/en) in Jena. She was especially fascinated by the broad diversity and complexity of microbial interactions. 

Her main research project in the last years was the investigation of bacterial induction of asexual fruiting in a beetle-associated fungus, which she started as an undergraduate at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology](https://www.ice.mpg.de/ext/index.php?id=home0) in Jena under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Peter Biedermann](http://www.insect-fungus.com/team/) and continued working on as a research collaborator in the lab of Prof. Dr. Thomas Harrington at Iowa State University. Afterward, she did her Master thesis in the group of [Dr. Matthew Agler](https://sites.google.com/view/microbiosis) to gain experience in plant-microbe interactions.

In 2019, she rejoined the newly established Emmy Noether group of Prof. Dr. Peter Biedermann at the University of WÃ¼rzburg as a research associate and conducted two research stays at the University of Copenhagen to complete the project she had started in her BSc thesis. 

Pamela is looking forward to extending her knowledge about microbial interactions to human pathogenic fungi as well as actively engage in fighting fungal diseases.

In her free time, Pamela enjoys creative activities, essential oils, reading, and spending time outdoors.
