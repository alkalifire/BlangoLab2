Matt was a postdoctoral fellow and small group leader at the [Leibniz-HKI](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html) in Jena, Germany with Prof. [Axel Brakhage](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/mam-head.html) studying fungal biology and pathogenesis. His work centered on the conidial (spore) surface proteome, the extracellular vesicle biology of host-pathogenesis, and the importance of non-coding RNA in fungi. He earned his PhD in Microbiology and Immunology studying the pathogenesis and biochemistry of uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* with Prof. [Matt Mulvey](https://bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/mulvey.php) at the University of Utah. He followed his PhD with a postdoctoral fellowship also at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) defining the endogenous pool of double-stranded RNA in mammalian immune cells with Prof. [Brenda Bass](https://biochem.utah.edu/bass/).

When not in the lab, Matt enjoys the great outdoors, [photography](https://mgblango.myportfolio.com/), and spending time with his wife and cats.
