__Tell me more__

Michael’s research focuses on RNA biology and host-pathogen interactions, with a particular interest in how the fungal pathogen *Rhizopus oryzae* manipulates host RNA splicing during infection. He completed his PhD in Integrative Plant Biology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA, where he investigated the role of an acyl-CoA binding protein in its role of regulation membrane fluidity in *Magnaporthe oryzae*. His background is in molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics, and he’s passionate about uncovering molecular strategies fungi use to colonize and infect their hosts. His broader interests include data-driven life science research and science communication.

Outside the lab, you can find Michael sketching on his graphic tablet, cooking his favorite dishes and editing travel videos.
