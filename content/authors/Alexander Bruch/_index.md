__Tell me more__

_Career_: Early on the fields of genetics and microbiology caught my special interest during my studies at the [University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/) from 2010 to 2015. More and more, I focused my attention on the field of RNA dependent gene regulation and its expanding influence on different physiological aspects. Hence, during my years of study I worked on different topics regarding RNA interference (RNAi) in _Dictyostelium discoideum_ and the ubiquitin related modifier 1 (Urm1) pathway in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.  

The latter provided a scientifically promising fusion of two distinct regulatory arms of gene expression: the ubiquitin related protein modification by Urm1 and the tRNA modification by wobble uridine thiolation. Modification of transfer RNAs (but also other RNA species) is a conserved event known since the 1960´s but moved more into focus by scientists in the last years, establishing the field of the epitranscriptome. Hence, I got highly interested in this field and decided to work for my PhD thesis on the physiological relevance of functionally cooperating tRNA modifications in bakers yeast under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Raffael Schaffrath](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb10/institute/biologie/fachgebiete/mikrobiologie/prof-dr-raffael-schaffrath.html) and [Dr. Roland Klassen](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb10/institute/biologie/fachgebiete/mikrobiologie/mitarbeiter/detailseite/person/1166-Roland-Klassen.html) in the frame work of the SPP1784 “Chemical Biology of native Nucleic Acid Modifications”. After finishing my PhD, I decided to change subject to further dig into other aspects of the RNA world and now focus on the importance of mobile RNA molecules during infection by facultative pathogenic fungi.
